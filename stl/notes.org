** Introduction
The file here are the sources required for 3D printed pieces.

These parts have been created using TinkerCAD, and exported in both OBJ as well
as STL file formats.

If required, the original designs can be made available for colabouration in
TinkerCAD. (At some stage the designs will be redone on a more open platform.)
