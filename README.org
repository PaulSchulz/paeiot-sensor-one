** Introduction
PAE IoT LoRaWAN Sensor Module

This project is a product of the [[https://github.com/PaulSchulz/paeiot-experimenters][Port Adelaide Enfield Libraries IoT Experimenters]]
group.

The latest details for this project can be found in the regular [[blog/index.org][status updates]].
Comments are most welcome. See the above link for the group details.

** Aim
Design and Build IoT LoRaWAN capable device which can be used for
environmental sensing.

The initial discussion paper (RFC) can be found here: [[https://github.com/PaulSchulz/paeiot-experimenters/blob/main/doc/rfc/00001-iot-lorawan-device.org][00001-iot-lorawan-device.org]]

The current project is based around the [[https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mkr-wan-1310][Arduino MRKWAN1310 board]], which uses a
SAND21 processor capable of low power operation, and a LoRa radio which allows
data logging via the LoRaWAN network.
