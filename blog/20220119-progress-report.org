* Summary

This is a quick update, rather than a full progress report, on some recent work
on the Sensor One. This is because I am a little excited to show off what has
been recently done.

I was thinking about taking the sensor a little further and seeing how easily it
could be made into an indoor unit. 

There has been some announcements about delaying when Schools are going to start
again this year, because of COVID-19. A friend, who is a principal at a Primary
School in South Australia, ran a project last year using a CO2 sensor to monitor
air quality, so the students could tell when more fresh air and ventilation was
required. Their project has been featured on the ABC and a video of their
efforts is available here: [[https://www.facebook.com/LobethalLutheranSchool/videos/296081939214976][ABC Report]]

The PAE IoT - Sensor One, Air Quality Sensor in able do the same things as the
Primary School's sensor (it uses the same sensor device) but it can also then
[[sensor-one-2-20220111.png][report the data]] in real time using the LoRaWAN radio network and The Things
Stack.

Our initial design of an indoors enclosure separated out the sensors and added a
small fan for drawing air. There was also room for an internal battery (LiPo) as
well as a second USB battery, or charging cable.

A 3D model was drawn up in [[https://www.tinkercad.com/][TinkerCAD]]...

... printed.

Then it was a /simple/ manner of putting all the electronics inside the enclosure.

Mistakes were found, and noted for correcting in the next iteration.

This unit is connected to power again (no battery yet), and is continuing to
report data, via The Things Network, NodeRED and InfluxDB to the Grafana
dashboard mentioned previously.
