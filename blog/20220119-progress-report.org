* Summary

This is a quick update, rathwr than a full progress report, on some recent work
on the Sensor One This is just because I am a little bit excited to show off
what I have been able to do recently.


I was thinking about taking the sensor a little further and seeing how easily it
could be made into an indoor unit, with what we have done so far. There has been
some announcements about when Schools are going to start again this year.

A fried, who is a principal at a Primary School in South Australia, ran a
project last year using a CO2 sensor to monitor air quality, so the students
could tell when more fresh air and ventilation was required. Their project has
been featured on the ABC and a video of their efforts is available here: [[https://www.facebook.com/LobethalLutheranSchool/videos/296081939214976][ABC
Report]]

The initial design of an enclosure separated out the sensors and added a small
fan for drawing air across them. There was also room for an internal battery
(LiPo) as well as a USB attached secondary battery, or charging cable.

A 3D model was drawn up in [[https://www.tinkercad.com/][TinkerCAD]]...

... printed.

Then it was a /simple/ manner of putting all the electronics inside the enclosure.

Mistakes were found, and noted for correcting in the next iteration.

This unit is connected to power again (no battery yet), and is continuing to
report data, via The Things Network, NodeRED and InfluxDB to the Grafana
dashboard mentioned previously.
