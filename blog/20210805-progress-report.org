** Introduction

Welcome to the first progress report for the "PAEIoT Sensor One" project.

** Progress
We have:
- Connected the Arduino MKRWAN1510 board to two DHT22 (AM2302) Temperature and
  Humidity sensors;
- Run the example LoRaWAN on the MKRWAN1510 (from the LORAWAN Arduino Library);
- Modified and written an Arduino sketch which reads the Temperature and Humidity Sensors and transmits them to an MQTT application via The Things Stack, *every 2 minutes*;
- Modified exiting *NodeRED* configuration to interpret data and save into
  *InfluxDB* database, which is then plotted with *Grafana* dashboard. (These
  services were already existing resources.); and
- Tested prototype, with battery and solar power charging. It ran for several days, reliably collecting data.

** Outstanding Issues
The following issues and problems need to be addressed.

***  Initial login and authentication with the LoRaWAN network
The LoRa radio does not authenticate with the LoRaWAN network reliably first
time (via OTAA). It will connect after several restarts/resets/power cycles.
Once connected, transmission and reception of data is 

** What to do next
- Make enquiries about LoRaWAN authentication issue.
- Extend cable on temperature sensor to support inside/outside measurements.
- Investigate enclosure options.
- Document wiring (wiring diagram).
- Add status LED.
  - Flash status when starting up.
  - Flash Status when connecting/connected to LoRaWAN
  - Flash status LED when transmitting.
- Create Github repository for "Sensor One" project

** What else to do...
*** Power budget calculations
- We need to work out how much power is being drawn from battery, and how much power we can get from solar panel.
- For how many 'cloudy' days can we remain powered and operating?

*** Radio Budget
- For how long is the LoRa radio transmitting?
