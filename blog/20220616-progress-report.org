** Progress Report - Thursday, 16 June 2022

Welcome to this (somewhat infrequent) update for the Sensor One IoT
project.

We have some big news.

Robert has been successful in obtaining a grant from National Science Week 2022
SA Community Grant for a microclimate measuring project in Port Adelaide Enfield
council - *From the coast to the foothills*

The sensors for the project will make use of the PAE IoT Experimenter's Group
Sensor One. While this is exciting, what is even better news is that we want to
use this opportunity to make the kit, with emphasis on a complete outdoor
environmental sensor package. The time frame for thisÂ is limited (about 4 months
in total), so the IoT Experimenter group is looking for people who may be able
to help out in many different ways.

The initial project kickoff meeting is being held during our regular meetup,
this Sunday, 19th June 2022, at 3pm at the Greenacres Library.

Some of the additional hardware features that can be looked at, in no
particular order:
- Adding a magnetic reset switch + circuit, for external sensor reset;
- Power usage measurement, and enabling microprocessor sleep modes;
- Add a watchdog circuit and automatic reset;
- Add power monitoring circuit (battery and power in); and
- Creating a version 2 of sensor circuit board.

Other useful activities:
- Robustness testing of sensors;
- Data modeling and analysis;
- Review of our IoT stack - The Things Network, NodeRED, InfluxDB and Grafana;
- NodeRED Flow Implementation;
- Grafana Dashboard Design;
- Documentation of hardware (bill of materials and build instructions), and
  project (blog and progress reports), including photography; and
- Design and preparation of 3D printed parts (if any).
