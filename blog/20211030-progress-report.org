** Introduction
This is the sixth progress report for the "PAEIoT Sensor One" project. Delivery
of two partially assembled sensors has been made to the Port Adelaide Library
IoT Project has been made.

These sensors have each been programmed two collect 4 channels of temperature
and humidity data every 10 minutes.

A box of a additional parts has been received for the Library project which will
be built into more sensors.

**** The Things Network
A lot of time was spent trying to make the MKRWAN1310 work with the available
Arduino Library (MKRWAN) and The Things Network (version 3). There have been a
lot of subtle and not so subtle changes in both these projects, which has broken
then end to end communication channel.

A new template for the MKRWAN1310 in the Australian region (using AU915) was
submitted to The Things Network, which aims to make it very simple to add this
device for Australian users. This was accepted and now appears in the list of
options available:

|------------------+----------------------|
| Brand            | Arduino SA           |
| Model            | Arduino MKR WAN 1310 |
| Hardware Ver.    | 1.0                  |
| Firmware Ver.    | 1.2.3                |
| Profile (Region) | AU_915_928           |
|------------------+----------------------|

When using the profile (see image) then Regional Frequency settings stillyy needs
to be tweeked after the device has been configured to choose 'Option B'.

**** Arduino WAN Firmware
The firmware that comes with the MLRWAN1310 is version 1.2.0 and needs to be
upgraded. A new version of the firmware (currently 1.3.0.0) is available via the
Web Editor, but it didn't work (unsure why at this stage).

The previous known working version 1.2.0 is being install via the desktop
Arduino editor, using MKRWAN library version 1.1.0.

**** Arduino Code
The Arduino code has had a lot of changes, with a new version "Sensor One v1.2 28
Oct 20211020"
- 4 Data channels are collected and transmitted via LoRaWAN (text format)
- Status LED turned on during transmission / reception window
- Simplified serial output
- Additional processing of null measurments
- Reading period set to 10 minutes

**** MKRWAN1310 Firmware
When working with the MKRWAN1310, the example Arduino sketches provided with the
MKRWAN library encourage that the MKRWAN1310 be upgraded to the latest firmware.
As of this moment, the version 1.3.0.0 of the firmware is available, but it    

** Outstanding Issues
*** Arduino 
Correspondence needs to be sent to Arduino, or an issue submitted,
regarding the new version of the MKRWAN1310 firmware (1.3.0), given that it
doesn't work. 

*** The Things Network
It is an issue that when configuring a device in The Things Network, the AU915
Band Plan option B (Regional Parameters version: PHY V1.0.2 REV B) still needs
to be set separately, and Option A is the default option.

** What to do next
*** TODO Produce a new version of circit board
Circuit board (hat) need to be redesigned with the following features:
- Add headers for 4 sensor channels
- Add header for 5V supply, instead of power from USB
- Add buck converter option (maybe)
- Add power and battery voltage sensing circuit (maybe)

*** TODO Arduino Code
**** Add status LED.
Add additional status messaging
  - Flash status when starting up.
  - Flash Status when connecting/connected to LoRaWAN
**** Modify to use Arduino Low Power library and confirm power savings.
  
** What else to do...
*** Create Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Include pricing and suppliers.
*** Create Installation Instructions
- How to download and use the code from this repository.
- How to connect up the sensors, battery, solar panel
*** Power budget calculations
- We need to work out how much power is being drawn from battery, and how much
  power we can get from solar panel.
- For how many 'cloudy' days can we remain powered and operating?
*** Radio Budget
- How long is the LoRa radio transmitting?

** For future versions
(Details will be included here as they are raised.)
