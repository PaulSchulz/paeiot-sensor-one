** Introduction
This is the fourth progress report for the "PAEIoT Sensor One" project. It has
been a while since that one has been written so I thought I might as well put
together a short update. (Sorry, no pictures).

** Progress
*** Prototyping
|-------------+---------------------------------------------+---------|
| Prototype 1 | Testing - On-going and good                 | ONGOING |
|             | Tempurature sensor enclosure added.         |         |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------+---------|
| Prototype 2 | Being costructed with PCB v1.0              | ONGOING |
|             | Using enclosure with internal micro antenna |         |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------+---------|
*** Fritzing
|-----------+--------------------------------------------+---------|
| Templates | New template found - MKRWAN1300            | DONE    |
|           | In correspondence with Arduino about       |         |
|           | correcting their version.                  |         |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------+---------|
| Circuit   | Diagram Completed                          | DONE    |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------+---------|
| Layout    | PCB updated to v1.1 with correct template. | ONGOING |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------+---------|
*** Coding
|-----------+------------------------------------------------+-------|
| Debugging | Issue found with initial Serial initialisaiton | FIXED |
|-----------+------------------------------------------------+-------|

** Outstanding Issues
*** TODO Upgrade Firmware on MRKLAN1301 and LAN Library
The existing MKRWAN1310 boards uses whatever the firmware was that came with the
board, and this needs to be updated. It has been suggested that the LoRaWAN connection issue is related to this.
*** TODO Order new version o circit board

** What (we still need to do) next
*** TODO Code
**** Add status LED.
  - Flash status when starting up.
  - Flash Status when connecting/connected to LoRaWAN
  - Flash status LED when transmitting.
**** Modify to use Arduino Low Power library and confirm power savings.
  
** What else to do...
*** Create Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Include pricing and suppliers.
*** Create Installation Instructions
- How to download and use the code from this repository.
- How to connect up the sensors, battery, solar panel
*** Power budget calculations
- We need to work out how much power is being drawn from battery, and how much
  power we can get from solar panel.
- For how many 'cloudy' days can we remain powered and operating?
*** Radio Budget
- How long is the LoRa radio transmitting?

** For future versions
*** Expand the number of sensor channels to 4. (Rework of PCB required.)
