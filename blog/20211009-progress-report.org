** Introduction
This is the fifth progress report for the "PAEIoT Sensor One" project.

** Progress
*** Events
During the last week, strong overnight winds blew over the greenhouse enclosure
containing Prototype 1 unit and caused the circuit board to get exposed to rain
and suffer water damage. Attempts for minimise the damage caused by corrosion
(soaking in isopropyl-alcohol and allowing to thoroughly dry out) did not
restore full functionality to the board. 

When powering on and monitoring via the serial port, the processor appears to be
working OK, but not the LoRa radio, which fail to respond during the radio
initialisation, which subsequently times out.

It is suspected that there is water damage, corrosion, or moisture under the
radio module shielding. This is an area which can not be readily inspected.

As a result, to continue testing, the second prototype board was functionally
completed and installed in its place. Prototype 2 (sally) uses the PCB v1.0 with
modifications, in the weather proof enclosure, with same battery, solar panel
and sensor as Prototype 1 (laura), as well as the addition of the internal micro
antenna.

*** Prototyping
**** DONE Prototype 1 (laura)
CLOSED: [2021-10-09 Sat 20:54]

Ongoing testing has ceased due to damage. Module Firmware: ARD-078 1.2.0 

**** ONGOING Prototype 2 (sally)
Prototype completed and installed for testing.
- Uses PCB v1.0 with modifications.
- Uses new internal micro antenna.
- Uses new board configuration process.
- Upgraded LoRa radio firmware: ARD-078 1.2.3
- Configured TTNv3 to accept data.
- Configured Grafana to plot data.
- Installed in testing location. 

*** Fritzing
**** ONGOING Layout
PCB updated to v1.1 with correct template.

*** Coding
**** DONE Debugging
CLOSED: [2021-10-09 Sat 21:05]
- Issue found with initial Serial initialisaiton

*** MKRWAN1310 Testing, Installation and Bring-up Process
- Use Arduino IDE with Device support and MKRWAN libraries. The web based IDE
  will have the most up to date version of the official libraries.
- Upgrade LoRa Firmware: From examples install sketch 'MKRWANFWUpdate_standalone'
- From examples, install 'FirstConfiguration' - change band plan from EU to AU915
  Add to sketch: modem.sendMask("ff000000f000ffff00020000");

** Outstanding Issues
*** CANCELLED Upgrade LAN Library
CLOSED: [2021-10-09 Sat 21:08]
Upgrading the radio module firmware (and removing the wait for the serial
connection) has allowed the sensor to now reliably connect to the LoRaWAN
network without any other issues.

*** CANCELLED Order new version o circit board
CLOSED: [2021-10-09 Sat 14:34]
Ordering new circuit boards now appears to include a 20 euro shipping fee which
wasn't included in the first batch. Need to investgate this before doing another
order or v1.1. May skip top v1.2 with additional functionality.

** What to do next
*** TODO Code
**** Add status LED
- Flash status when starting up.
- Flash Status when connecting/connected to LoRaWAN
- Flash status LED when transmitting.
**** Modify to use low power settings and confirm power usage
- Add the Arduino Low Power library
*** TODO Create Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Include pricing and suppliers.  
*** TODO Rework PCB
- Expand number of sensor channels to 4
- Add option for 5V power-in with Buck Converter, instead of USB.
*** TODO Rework Base plate design
- Expand battery slot to hold 
  
** What else to do
*** Investigate additional waterproofing
- Conformal coating / potting for MKRWAN1310.
- Water proofing cabling into/out-of enclosure.
*** Create Installation Instructions
- How to test and install, upgrade sotware on MKRWAN1310.
- How to download and use the code from this repository.
- How to connect up the sensors, battery, solar panel
*** Power budget calculations
- We need to work out how much power is being drawn from battery, and how much
  power we can get from solar panel.
- For how many 'cloudy' days can we remain powered and operating?
*** Radio Budget
- How long is the LoRa radio transmitting?
