** Introduction

Second progress report for the "PAEIoT Sensor One" project.

[[file:../images/20210803_163039_resized.jpg]]

** Progress
We have:
- Continued with ongoing testing of first prototype. It has continued to run
  well in wintery weather condition.
- Had a conversation with *Arduino.CC* (thanks Robert) and amongst other things
  discussed the OTAA authentication issue.
- Received two waterproof boxes for mounting the sensor. These boxes from
  [[https://adafruit.com][Adefruit]] cost US$9.95 and include two cable glands.
- Designed and 3D Printed a baseplate for mounting the Arduino MKRWAN1310,
  battery and cable connections.
- Received a [[https://core-electronics.com.au/usb-power-meter-color-tft-lcd.html][USB Power Monitor]] and started looking at power usage of the sensor
  board. (The solar panel was producing 0.141A @ 5.25V for powering the board
  and recharging the battery.)
- Started investigating '[[https://fritzing.org/][Fritzing]]' to produce a wiring diagram. (See the
  fritzing directory.) Fritzing also allows easy creation of circuit board
  layouts, as well as easy ordering and production. It is possible to produce 6
  double sided boards to fit onto the MKRWAN1310 for 11.09â‚¬.

** Outstanding Issues
*** (In progress) Initial login and authentication with the LoRaWAN network
See above.

** Other Issues
*** The [[https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Huxley][ReprapPro Huxley]] 3D printer being used is having reliability issues. It will print the first layer reliably, but then fail on the second or so. It proably needs the hot-end rebuilt. 

** What (we still need to do) next
- Extend cable on temperature sensor to support inside/outside measurements.
- Complete wiring diagram.
- Add status LED.
  - Flash status when starting up.
  - Flash Status when connecting/connected to LoRaWAN
  - Flash status LED when transmitting.
- Modify to use Arduino Low Power library and confirm power savings.

** What else to do...
*** Create Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Include pricing and suppliers.
*** Create Installation Instructions
- How to download and use the code from this repository.
- How to connect up the sensors, battery, solar panel
*** Power budget calculations
- We need to work out how much power is being drawn from battery, and how much
  power we can get from solar panel.
- For how many 'cloudy' days can we remain powered and operating?
*** Radio Budget
- How long is the LoRa radio transmitting?
