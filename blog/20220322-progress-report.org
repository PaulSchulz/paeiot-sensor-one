A quick update for March. Almost all of the sensors stopped working in one way or
another during this last period.

** Comments on Coding with Arduino IDEs
The following comments relate to using the various Arduino IDE's on Ubuntu 21.10. 

*** Arduino IDE v2

I decided to give the new (beta) Arduino development environment a go. It was a
very frustration experienced. It promises a lot with a new look and feel and
better library management, but it fell down with the management of the USB
programming and serial interface.

It would regularly, and without any obvious cause, stop being able to access the
device. Auto detection appeared to work well, but it than would not correctly
connect, or be able to program again after the Arduino MKR board was reset.

*** Arduino Cloud IDE

The Arduino Cloud IDE (browser based) works very well. An agent program needs to
be downloaded and run to allow it to access the USB ports for programming and
serial monitoring.

The library management is even extensive as all available online libraries are
available directly from within the tool. 

Compiling is done in the cloud, and the result is then downloaded to the
attached Arduino device, which was detected automatically.

The biggest issue I found was that there is a limit on the amount of compile
time is available (200 sec per day) under the free account level. It didn't take
very long to hit this limit.

*** Arduino IDE v1

I downloaded and updated to the latest version of the original Arduino IDE, and
was pleasantly surprised at how well it still worked.

The separate serial monitor can be made as big as required, and works well. 

While it isn't Emacs, it was still the easiest way to develop software for the
Sensor-One project.

** Investigating the CJMCU-8128 Sensor Board

This board is an I2C sensor board which combines three sensor chips. 

There was some confusion when wiring up the board, which was originally
connected directly to the I2C socket on the MKR board, which provides 5V rather
then 3.3V. This may have damaged the sensors, and the MKR board did not actually
boot in this configuration.

Correctly connecting the sensor to the 3.3V supply allowed the sensor to be read correctly.
