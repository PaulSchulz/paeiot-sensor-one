** Introduction

This is the third progress report for the "PAEIoT Sensor One" project.

** Progress
We have:
- Continued with ongoing testing of first prototype. It has continued to run
  well in wintery weather condition. Recorded Adelaide's coldest day of the year
  on Friday, 27 August
- 3D Printed better baseplate (2 copies) using the #d Printer at the PAE Library Maker Space at the Parks Library.
- Initial attempt with '[[https://fritzing.org/][Fritzing]]' to produce a printed circuit board as shield
  See file in 'fritzing' directory for sources.
- Build a weather shield enclosure for external sensor.

** Outstanding Issues
*** Upgrade Firmware on MRKLAN1301 and LAN Library

** What (we still need to do) next
- Extend cable on temperature sensor to support inside/outside measurements.
- Complete wiring diagram.
- Add status LED.
  - Flash status when starting up.
  - Flash Status when connecting/connected to LoRaWAN
  - Flash status LED when transmitting.
- Modify to use Arduino Low Power library and confirm power savings.

** What else to do...
*** Create Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Include pricing and suppliers.
*** Create Installation Instructions
- How to download and use the code from this repository.
- How to connect up the sensors, battery, solar panel
*** Power budget calculations
- We need to work out how much power is being drawn from battery, and how much
  power we can get from solar panel.
- For how many 'cloudy' days can we remain powered and operating?
*** Radio Budget
- How long is the LoRa radio transmitting?

** Other Notes
*** Using Image Magick to rescale images
On my Ubuntu Laptop, images and photos for this blog have been re-scaled using the
'convert' tool from the Image Magick suite of tools

The following will produce a resized image with height 300px.

  convert $FILE -resize x300 ${FILE%.jpg}_resized.jpg
